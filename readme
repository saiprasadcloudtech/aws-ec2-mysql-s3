# Once we launch a ubuntu server as a web server below are the steps to be performed in it.
sudo apt-get update   # to update the ubuntu server 
sudo apt-get install mysql-client    # Need to install sql-client in ubuntu server which will interact with the backend Mysql server ( Amazon RDS) 

# create a bucket under the same region 

# For python and related frameworks below python modules needs to be installed 
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-flask
sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql
sudo apt-get install python3-boto3

# we need to create database and tables inside the database using the below command 
mysql -h <database-endpoint> -u <username> -p # login to database from ubuntu server using mysql client 
mysql> create database <name>;                # create a database 
mysql> use <database_name>                    # select the database where you want to create table
mysql> create table <table_name>(column_1 varchar(20),column_2 varchar(20).......)

# update the config file inside the repository
customhost = "employee.coimdn2g2ddd.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com"
customuser = "cloudtechsai"
custompass = "roopa007"
customdb = "employee"
custombucket = "addemployee2021"
customregion = "us-east-1"

# We need to clone this github repository with web server for deployment 
ubuntu$ git clone https://github.com/saiprasadcloudtech/aws-ec2-mysql-s3.git        # cloning github with web server to deploy the code and app

# assign a role to ec2 to that it can access s3

# create hosted zone under route 53 
# for domain name you can create a free domain from freenom.com
# To connect your free domain to route 53 you must copy all the nameservers created under hosted zone record set and paste in into freenom dashboard 
# Now to connect route 53 to web server create 2 record set under hosted zone ( one without www and other with www prefix )
# once the above steps are complete , you can access the website using the free domain name which we created
